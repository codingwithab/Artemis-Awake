We have created an iPad application which is needed in order to track the Astronaut’s activity and to monitor how they are working. The focus is on sleep, nutrition and exercise. However, more tasks can be added. The iPad app prompts the user to let them know whether they need to continue with the task they have edited or whether they should stop. When another astronaut gets added onto the application, an email is sent to NASA to let them know the details of the new member. Astronauts and tasks can be deleted or modified.
