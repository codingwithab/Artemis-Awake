NASA SpaceApps - An iPad application created in order to track the Astronautâ€™s activity and to monitor how they are working. The focus is on sleep, nutrition and exercise. 

However, more tasks can be added. The iPad app prompts the user to let them know whether they need to continue with the task they have edited or whether they should stop. When another astronaut gets added onto the application, an email is sent to NASA to let them know the details of the new member. Astronauts and tasks can be deleted or modified.

The sleep scheduling tool focuses on the amount completed in percentage for the task allocated. An alert is shown depending on the percentage completed. It could either give an alert to tell the user to continue with the task or it would tell the user that they have completed the task.
